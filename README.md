# Impacts-Of-Climate-On-Food-Production
# Data Visualization

#  Project Summary
• The purpose of this project is to visualize the correlation between climatic factors
like Rainfall, Temperature with Food production and supply in India based on past
data. It would give a glance on the correlation and predict the change on
production over the time.
• It will also predict the price change based on change in production. It will also
provide a real time data analysis where it would take Annual rainfall and Annual
Temperature and give predict the change on production and price.

# Keywords:

# Number of Modules
The developed system consist of three modules

• Overview:

Simple overview of correlation between yearly production , yields, area
of Food with Annual Rainfall and Temperature

• Detailed Analysis

Providing the graphical view and analysis of correlation between yearly
production , yields, area of Food with Annual Rainfall and Temperature

• Realtime Data Analysis

Providing Analysis of Real time Rainfall and Temperature data on how it
will affect the production and price of food

The following modules are implemented on Jupyter-notebook and GUI as well
